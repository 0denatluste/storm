## What are CS 1.6 M4A1 Gold Skins?
 
CS 1.6 M4A1 gold skins are mods that change the appearance of the M4A1 rifle in Counter-Strike 1.6.

Some gold skins also have different patterns or designs on them, such as coils, stripes, or logos.
 
Gold skins do not affect the performance or stats of the M4A1 in any way. They are purely cosmetic and only visible to you and other players who have the same skin installed.
